2. Worked on CV project at Celebal Technologies - extracting tables format data from receipts using Detectron

### 🧰 Personal Projects 🧰
## Predicting the readmission rate of diabetic patients using machine learning for better healthcare.
- Implemented end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline right from data cleaning to model deployment on AWS EC2
instance, demonstrating full stack machine learning skills.
- Hospitals in the USA are penalized by the government if the patient is readmitted to the hospital within 30 days.
Hospitals however have no means of predicting which patient will be readmitted. This project a [Blog](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/building-machine-learning-model-to-predict-if-the-patient-will-be-readmitted-within-30-days-2eaed2d3669d) [code](https://github.com/rishikeshF/Diabetic_patient_readmission_rate_predictor)
